Add Broadcasting and node detection
Add Proxy interface
Have the DB be lookup'd (Right now, it does nothing)
Also Have Ip-> UUID in the DB as well and have files listed under a UUID
Fix the file Extention showing up in the db
Have a IP DB done
Change DB structure to
{hash:{host:"uid", last-modified:437894}}
Have the node respond a FOUND or NOT_FOUND if the file exists in cache
Have the client delete entry in db if the node does not have the file
New DB is flawed, change it to {hash:[{date-modified:342324, host:uid}{date-modified:38294, host:uid}]}?
Add function to find out internet conditions, either by speedtest server or like ants (possitive feedback of downloads - ie. if there are lots of clients downloading, then download conditions must be good?)
